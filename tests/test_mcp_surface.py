"""The registry <-> tools invariant, plus a tools/list smoke test.

Every tool declared in :mod:`woow_litellm_mcp_server.registry` must be
registered by exactly one tool module, and every registered tool must be
declared in the registry. If these two drift apart the admin GUI (which reads
the registry) will name tools that do not exist, or vice-versa.
