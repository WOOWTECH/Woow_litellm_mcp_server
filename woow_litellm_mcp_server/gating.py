"""Three-level tool gating: category, tool, operation, plus read-only mode.

The gate is built from :class:`~woow_litellm_mcp_server.settings.Settings` and is
consulted by each tool module's ``register`` function so disabled tools are
never even registered on the FastMCP server.

Precedence (a tool is enabled only if ALL hold):
  1. its category is not in ``disabled_categories``;
  2. its name is not in ``disabled_tools``;
  3. read-only mode is off OR the tool is not ``dangerous``;
  4. at least one of the tool's declared operations is still allowed.

Rule 4 is what makes the operations column in the admin GUI real. Every tool in
the registry declares exactly the operations it performs, so disabling the only
operation a tool has (or turning on read-only, which disables every non-``read``
operation) removes the tool from the surface entirely — it is never registered
on the FastMCP server, so ``tools/list`` shrinks and ``tools/call`` 404s.

Operation gating additionally filters the operations a still-enabled tool may
perform via ``disabled_operations`` (entries may be ``"tool:op"`` or bare
``"op"``); in read-only mode only the ``read`` operation survives. Mutating
tools additionally call :meth:`ToolGate.require_operation` in their handler
body, so a gate that changes shape between registration and invocation still
refuses the upstream call instead of performing it.
